## Introduction

React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

React is the most used library among developers over the years. React is not a framework; it's a library that exclusively concentrates on the app's user interface layer. To create a complete development toolkit for your project, you still need to select other technologies."
