## Introduction

<img src="/src/assets/frameworks/trpc/react_icon.png" alt="React" icon width="250" height="250">

React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. The UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. React is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

React is the most used library among developers over the years. React is not a framework; it's a library that exclusively concentrates on the app's user interface layer. To create a complete development toolkit for your project, you still need to select other technologies.

## Brief History

- 2011: React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. Initially, React was called FaxJS and was an early prototype of React.

- 2012: React was continued and adopted in the image-sharing service Instagram.

- 2013: In 2013, React was open-sourced, allowing developers outside Facebook to use and contribute to the project. This move quickly attracted attention from the web development community.

- React pioneered the concept of the Virtual DOM in the same year, introducing a lightweight, in-memory representation of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). This innovation significantly improved performance by reducing the need for direct manipulation of the DOM.

- React quickly gained wider adoption in various tech communities, becoming available on platforms like JSFiddle (June 2), integrated with Ruby on Rails (July 30), and extended to Python applications (August 19).

- The JSConfEU 2013 conference featured a speech by Pete Hunt that challenged established best practices, contributing to React's recognition and adoption.

- In December, David Nolen introduced OM, a library based on React, which helped showcase React's superiority over other alternatives, furthering its acknowledgment and popularity.

- 2014: React continued to gain popularity, particularly for enterprise adoption, emphasizing stability and reliability.

- 2015: Early in the year, Flipboard released React Canvas, demonstrating React's versatility.

- React Native was introduced this year, bringing React's principles to mobile app development, enabling developers to create cross-platform mobile applications using React and native components.

- In January Facebook unveiled the first version of React Native, enabling cross-platform mobile app development.

- - Same month, Netflix expressed interest in React, signaling its growing adoption.

Airbnb also started using React for web development in early 2015.

- In June, ReactEurope 2016 brought the React community together for further discussions and innovations.

- In July, React introduced its Error Code System, improving error handling and debugging in React applications.

- In November, Blueprint was introduced, a React UI toolkit for web development, further expanding the React ecosystem.

- 2017: Early this year, Airbnb introduced React Sketch.app, a new open-source library.

- In April, React Fiber was open-sourced at F8 2017, making it accessible to a wider developer community.

- In July, the Apache Software Foundation announced that Apache projects were not allowed to use a particular additional license.
